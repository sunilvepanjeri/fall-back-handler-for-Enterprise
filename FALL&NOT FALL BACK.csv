"At Truist Bank, certain bond types require manual processing due to their unique characteristics or complex redemption conditions. Here are the special bond types and the reasons they need manual handling:

Callable Bonds

Reason: Need to confirm call provisions
These bonds can be redeemed by the issuer before maturity, requiring verification of specific call terms and dates.
Zero-Coupon Bonds

Reason: Need to calculate accrued interest
These bonds don't pay periodic interest, so the accrued interest must be manually calculated at redemption.
Foreign Issuer Bonds

Reason: Require cross-border processing
These involve international transactions, potentially requiring currency conversion and adherence to foreign regulations.
Restricted Securities

Reason: Require additional regulatory checks
These securities have restrictions on their sale or transfer, necessitating extra compliance verifications.
Convertible Bonds

Reason: Need to verify conversion terms
These bonds can be converted into equity, requiring careful review of conversion ratios and timing.
For all these special cases, advisors should select 'Manual Processing' in Advisor Desktop and route the request to Bond Redemption Operations. This ensures that each case receives the necessary specialized attention and processing.

Manual processing allows for:

Thorough review of complex terms and conditions
Accurate calculations of non-standard interest or redemption values
Compliance with specific regulatory requirements
Proper handling of any unique features or clauses in the bond agreement
It's important to note that manual processing may extend the typical redemption timeline. Advisors should communicate this to clients and set appropriate expectations for processing times.

Reporting:

"Householding in Truist Bank's financial investment services is a feature that allows multiple accounts belonging to the same household to receive a single consolidated mailing. Here's an overview of householding and its benefits for clients:

What is Householding? Householding is the process of consolidating multiple account statements and communications into a single mailing or electronic delivery for accounts within the same household.

Benefits for Clients:

Reduced Redundancy: Clients receive fewer separate mailings, reducing clutter and paperwork.

Improved Convenience: All account information is consolidated in one place, making it easier to review and manage finances.

Customizable Delivery: Clients can choose between physical mail or e-delivery for their householded statements.

Flexible Frequency: Householding can be set for monthly, quarterly, or annual statement cycles, based on client preferences.

Cost-Effective: Reduces mailing costs for physical statements, which may result in lower fees for clients.

Environmental Impact: Less paper usage for clients who opt for consolidated physical mailings or e-delivery.

Simplified Record-Keeping: Easier to track and store financial records with consolidated statements.

Family Financial Overview: Provides a comprehensive view of the household's financial position across multiple accounts.

Privacy: Reduces the number of separate financial mailings coming to a household, potentially enhancing privacy.

Customization Options: Certain accounts (e.g., trust accounts) can be excluded from householding if separate statements are required.

Important Considerations:

All account holders must agree to householded statement delivery.
A primary statement recipient must be designated for the consolidated mailing.
Advisors should periodically verify householding preferences with clients.
Householding settings can be updated or removed as client needs change.

➡️ Advisor Support -> Document Information -> Locating Heritage BB&T Account

Heritage BB&T accounts are accounts that were originally held with BB&T (Branch Banking and Trust Company) prior to its merger with SunTrust Banks, which formed Truist Financial Corporation. These accounts require a special search process due to several factors:

Merger Complexity:

The merger of BB&T and SunTrust created a complex integration of systems and accounts.
Not all accounts were immediately migrated to the new Truist platform.
Varied Migration Status:

Most BB&T accounts have been migrated to the new Truist platform.
However, some accounts may still reside in legacy BB&T systems.
Certain account types (e.g., Trust, IRAs) may have specialized migration handling.
Multiple Systems:

Accounts may be found in different systems:
Advisor Desktop
Wealthscape
Legacy BB&T archival systems
Specialized Access Requirements:

Advisors may need special credentials to access legacy BB&T systems.
For some pre-merger accounts, assistance from Operations may be required.
Data Conversion Challenges:

Ensuring accurate mapping of account details during the conversion process.
The need to reference the latest conversion mapping when verifying account details.
Historical Documentation:

In some cases, electronic searches may be unsuccessful, requiring review of historical statements or client documentation.
Compliance and Legal Considerations:

Some accounts may have special handling requirements due to legal or compliance restrictions.
Time-Sensitive Nature:

As time passes, locating these legacy accounts becomes more challenging, necessitating a thorough search process.
The special search process is designed to navigate these complexities and ensure that all potential locations for Heritage BB&T accounts are checked. This process typically involves:

Searching in Advisor Desktop's Legacy BB&T Account Lookup section
Checking Wealthscape and internal databases
Accessing archived BB&T systems (with special credentials if necessary)
Reviewing migration databases
Submitting Legacy Account Lookup requests to Operations if needed
Confirming details with clients and reviewing any historical documentation they may have
This multi-step approach helps ensure that Heritage BB&T accounts are accurately located and properly managed within the new Truist system, maintaining continuity of service for clients and compliance with regulatory requirements.

➡️ Advisor Support -> Confirms -> Managed Accounts Only - Bundling Trade Confirms

Bundling trade confirmations is a process that allows multiple trades executed within a managed account to be consolidated into a single confirmation statement. This practice is beneficial for several reasons:

Simplified Reporting

Instead of receiving individual confirmations for each trade, clients receive a consolidated statement.
This reduces paperwork and makes it easier for clients to review their account activity.
Enhanced Client Experience

Clients can choose between daily or monthly bundled confirms based on their preferences.
This customization allows for a more tailored approach to client communication.
Streamlined Communication

Reduces the frequency of communications, which can be particularly beneficial for actively managed accounts.
Helps prevent information overload for clients while still providing necessary trade details.
Operational Efficiency

Consolidating multiple trades into a single confirmation reduces processing time and resources for the bank.
Operations can review and format confirm details more efficiently before finalization.
Compliance and Documentation

Ensures compliance with trade documentation requirements while reducing the volume of individual confirmations.
Allows for systematic review of trade execution timestamps and securities involved in the bundling.
Flexibility for Different Account Types

Particularly useful for Periodic Investment Plans (PIPs), allowing scheduled investments without individual confirmations for each transaction.
Adaptable to various managed account structures, including discretionary and advisory accounts.
Improved Record Keeping

Bundled confirmations are easier to track and maintain for both clients and advisors.
Facilitates the 7-year retention requirement for trade confirm records.
Cost Reduction

Reduces printing and mailing costs associated with sending individual trade confirmations.
Supports environmental initiatives by reducing paper usage.
Enhanced Advisory Role

Allows advisors to focus on higher-value activities rather than explaining multiple individual trade confirmations.
Provides a more comprehensive view of account activity, facilitating better discussions with clients.
Important Considerations:

Advisors must ensure bundled confirms align with client documentation and regulatory requirements.
Clients must acknowledge and agree to the bundling preference.
Advisors should verify client receipt of bundled confirmations and address any questions or discrepancies promptly.

➡️ Advisor Support -> Confirms -> PIPs - Periodic Investments - No Confirms

The purpose of bundling trade confirmations for Periodic Investment Plans (PIP) is to streamline the reporting process for clients with scheduled, recurring investments. Here are the key points and benefits:

Simplified Reporting:

Clients receive bundled periodic confirmations instead of individual trade confirmations for each transaction.
This reduces the volume of paperwork and simplifies record-keeping for clients.
Customized Frequency:

Confirmations can be bundled on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on client preferences.
This flexibility allows clients to choose a reporting schedule that best suits their needs.
Efficient Communication:

Bundled confirmations provide a consolidated view of all PIP transactions over a specific period.
This makes it easier for clients to track their recurring investments and overall portfolio performance.
Reduced Administrative Burden:

For advisors and the bank, bundling reduces the frequency of generating and sending trade confirmations.
This can lead to cost savings and improved operational efficiency.
Compliance and Oversight:

Despite the bundling, the process still maintains regulatory compliance.
Compliance reviews ensure proper PIP enrollment, client acknowledgment, and adherence to chosen confirmation frequency.
Client Convenience:

Clients receive confirmations via their preferred delivery method (e.g., email, mail).
This convenience can enhance client satisfaction and engagement with their investment activities.
Focused Attention:

By receiving consolidated reports, clients can focus on overall investment trends rather than individual transactions.
This can promote a longer-term perspective on investment performance.
Environmental Consideration:

Reducing the number of individual confirmations sent can have a positive environmental impact by decreasing paper usage and associated resources.
Important Notes:

Bundling is only available for systematic, scheduled investments in PIPs.
Clients must explicitly opt into the bundling program and provide signed acknowledgment.
Advisors must ensure that bundling aligns with client preferences and regulatory requirements.
Trade confirm records, including bundled confirmations, must be retained for 7 years.
